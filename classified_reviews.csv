"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team. It brings you back to the silly finale of the very first movie, pity!",wont say anything other that ilsas demise ruined the franchise for me and also why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in hollywood movies anyway thats just an opinion but did not appreciate it i read somewhere that this made sense to the story aka ethan running around to save two women because one had to die likewhat no just no writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the emotional growth of the main hero that does not take away from the fact that ilsas character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in ethans team it brings you back to the silly finale of the very first movie pity,Positive
"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition. Show, don't tell, seems to have been forgotten.It's like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look like.Paint by numbers, but with film making.The action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise, well done, high octane and professional.There isn't anything wrong with the acting either. It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative
"I would have loved to enjoy this meeting but I simply could not.In prior M:I installments, there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling. But this time, I concur with someone who wrote earlier in a review that the story is soulless and empty.I found it a string of reprised sheer impossible action scènes stringed together by an excuse of a story line that made me feel like I missed the first half hour in which the stage was set - as such, I never got invested in the story.And it is not that there was not enough time to tell a story as we will most likely get a part 2 too.I get that this is an action movie and not a documentary. But it is all to improbable and even if it could happen irl, it has been done before, but in a better fashion.I wonder what part 2 will bring; to paraphrase Waldorf & Statler: ""probably stuff that was not good enough for the first one.""",i would have loved to enjoy this meeting but i simply could notin prior mi installments there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling but this time i concur with someone who wrote earlier in a review that the story is soulless and emptyi found it a string of reprised sheer impossible action scènes stringed together by an excuse of a story line that made me feel like i missed the first half hour in which the stage was set  as such i never got invested in the storyand it is not that there was not enough time to tell a story as we will most likely get a part 2 tooi get that this is an action movie and not a documentary but it is all to improbable and even if it could happen irl it has been done before but in a better fashioni wonder what part 2 will bring to paraphrase waldorf  statler probably stuff that was not good enough for the first one,Positive
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative
"I would have loved to enjoy this meeting but I simply could not.In prior M:I installments, there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different some with more success than others the overall vibe i have with this comes closest to matching those i have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011s ghost protocol solidly made and overall enjoyable but imperfect not as outwardly grabbing troubled by issues with the writing and less certain to demand viewership once or to inspire a second viewing im glad for those who get more out of this picture than i do we all have our personal preferences for my money excellent as it may be in many ways in some critical ones the latest mission impossible comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive check it out by all means if its an action flick you want its an action flick youll get dead reckoning just doesnt have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren and to me therein lies the problem,Positive
"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition. Show, don't tell, seems to have been forgotten.It's like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look like.Paint by numbers, but with film making.The action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise, well done, high octane and professional.There isn't anything wrong with the acting either. It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them. When you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldn't be a need for a part two, but its all set up for that to happen and it's fair to say I will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensAs per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen , very similar to the James Bond films.",beautiful locations with beautiful women and plenty of action but is that enoughprobably not with a pretty absurd plot and tom cruise starting to show his age yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them when you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldnt be a need for a part two but its all set up for that to happen and its fair to say i will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensas per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen  very similar to the james bond films,Positive

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a series that ive missed much of in the first place ever since the first sequel given the chance to watch all of tom cruises mission impossible films though my curiosity got the best of me and im happy to say it was rewarded much more than not all of them have been pretty enjoyable in one measure or another theres inconsistency from one title to the next and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends theres not really any going wrong here all the same its fair to wonder how cruise and returning filmmaker christopher mcquarrie could follow up 2018s fallout which while still not my personal favorite that would be 2006s mi3 was surely the most polished focused and balanced up to this point not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next how does dead reckoning stack up compared to its forebears to be honest i find myself surprised i do like this seventh feature and it more or less fits in with its kin but in my opinion its an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessorfor as much as fallout was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity its writing not least i dont think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case dont get me wrong in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work from a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that its genuinely pleasing and much the same goes for the sound design i love lorne balfes dynamic score even as  contrary to a few years before  it borrows more from lalo schifrins original theme and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast the stunts practical effects fight scenes and otherwise action sequences the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time are utterly outstanding the computer generated imagery thats used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could though as ever the more we see of it the worse it looks all this is swell its mcquarrie and erik jendresens screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed raising a quizzical eyebrow and some other facets are impacted in turnfrom the outset the premise involving supersmart artificial intelligence brings to mind numerous abject scifi flicks of the past from the terminator and demon seed to bmovies of the 50s after fallout so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props it seems strange for dead reckoning to fully embrace them granted its not as if ethan hunt is facing off against cyborgs and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist but its a sharp turn for the series and its definitely not just about the hitech gadgetry i do have to ask is it just me is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time there are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavyhanded practically browbeating us with the dialogue and scene writing as a prime example look to one of the earliest scenes where mcquarrie and jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape describe ethan hunt as if he were a comic book superhero and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels there are the flashbacks not fully fleshed out and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as mi6 had then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag.

"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner. Just another day at the office, folks.",in the latest installment of how many times can tom cruise defy age mission impossible  dead reckoning takes the cake or should we say the cruciform key this time around ethan hunt played by the man who apparently sips from the fountain of youth embarks on a journey that makes the da vinci code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox the plot thickens faster than a bowl of dayold oatmeal as hunt chases after a nextgen russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue ai  because apparently whats a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypsethe imf teams globetrotting adventure takes us from the empty quarter of the arabian desert to a highstakes party in venice thats so extravagant even the kardashians would pause along the way hunt and his squad including the evercharming benji dunn and luther stickell dodge betrayals impersonate partygoers and grapple with a villainous ai thats moodier than a teenager denied wifi the action scenes are so intense youll find yourself clutching your popcorn like its the last lifeboat on the titanic especially during the climactic traintop tussle that redefines mind the gapethan hunts moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and doublecrosses all while maintaining that signature run weve come to know and love mission impossible  dead reckoning delivers a cocktail of thrills spills and a plot so convoluted it could make a gps unit sob in the end its a 45star rollercoaster that proves once again no mission is too impossible for ethan hunt especially if it involves saving the world before dinner just another day at the office folks,Negative
"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face.

Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them. When you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldn't be a need for a part two, but its all set up for that to happen and it's fair to say I will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensAs per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen , very similar to the James Bond films.",beautiful locations with beautiful women and plenty of action but is that enoughprobably not with a pretty absurd plot and tom cruise starting to show his age yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them when you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldnt be a need for a part two but its all set up for that to happen and its fair to say i will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensas per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen  very similar to the james bond films,Positive

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a series that ive missed much of in the first place ever since the first sequel given the chance to watch all of tom cruises mission impossible films though my curiosity got the best of me and im happy to say it was rewarded much more than not all of them have been pretty enjoyable in one measure or another theres inconsistency from one title to the next and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends theres not really any going wrong here all the same its fair to wonder how cruise and returning filmmaker christopher mcquarrie could follow up 2018s fallout which while still not my personal favorite that would be 2006s mi3 was surely the most polished focused and balanced up to this point not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next how does dead reckoning stack up compared to its forebears to be honest i find myself surprised i do like this seventh feature and it more or less fits in with its kin but in my opinion its an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessorfor as much as fallout was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity its writing not least i dont think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case dont get me wrong in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work from a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that its genuinely pleasing and much the same goes for the sound design i love lorne balfes dynamic score even as  contrary to a few years before  it borrows more from lalo schifrins original theme and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast the stunts practical effects fight scenes and otherwise action sequences the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time are utterly outstanding the computer generated imagery thats used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could though as ever the more we see of it the worse it looks all this is swell its mcquarrie and erik jendresens screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed raising a quizzical eyebrow and some other facets are impacted in turnfrom the outset the premise involving supersmart artificial intelligence brings to mind numerous abject scifi flicks of the past from the terminator and demon seed to bmovies of the 50s after fallout so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props it seems strange for dead reckoning to fully embrace them granted its not as if ethan hunt is facing off against cyborgs and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist but its a sharp turn for the series and its definitely not just about the hitech gadgetry i do have to ask is it just me is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time there are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavyhanded practically browbeating us with the dialogue and scene writing as a prime example look to one of the earliest scenes where mcquarrie and jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape describe ethan hunt as if he were a comic book superhero and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels there are the flashbacks not fully fleshed out and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as mi6 had then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy  watch for the action sequence just after the onehour mark or a late shot of an actor having their william shatner screaming khan moment  or that are very nearly so parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for keaton or chaplin elsewhere the writing is weirdly selfparodying as if dead reckoning were a deadpan sendup a la john carpenters ghosts of mars with this latter quality in mind some odds and ends dont come off so well some overzealous cinematography or editing a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence some otherwise artistic shot composition how the female characters are written and more mcquarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self what happened hereplease understand i do enjoy this movie so much about it looks and sounds superb the cast is splendid and i believe in this case the women all given only supporting parts rather outshine their male costars i look forward to seeing more from hayley atwell who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle rebecca ferguson needs no introduction nor vanessa kirby and kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around pom klementieff to my delight might be one of the top highlights here as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold vicious paris while the writing and in turn mcquarries direction and oversight of the whole lends to some tidbits that i find questionable the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable why though the details are less surefooted and open to dissection the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid ill even go so far as to say that i  someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly exactly or more than three hours long  think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly and

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains?

I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws.

strap in for a wild ride but dont expect a masterpiece mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers on its promise of action with adrenalinepumping sequences that will leave you breathless however the films complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choiceskeeping track of the players the large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention youll need to remember whos who and their motivations which can be challenging especially during the films fastpaced momentscar chases with diminishing returns while the action sequences are impressive particularly the motorcycle chase through rome some car chases feel unnecessarily long dragging down the films momentumpushing the boundaries of believability the mission impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible but even for this series some moments stretch credulity too far venice usually teeming with tourists appears eerily empty pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limitsvisually stunning but not oscarworthy the special effects are undeniably impressive but the film relies heavily on them sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development while technically proficient the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experienceoverall mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a fun actionpacked ride but its not without its flaws if youre looking for a mindbending thriller you might be disappointed however if you crave heartstopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure this film delivers",Negative
"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

not least i dont think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case dont get me wrong in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work from a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that its genuinely pleasing and much the same goes for the sound design i love lorne balfes dynamic score even as  contrary to a few years before  it borrows more from lalo schifrins original theme and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast the stunts practical effects fight scenes and otherwise action sequences the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time are utterly outstanding the computer generated imagery thats used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could though as ever the more we see of it the worse it looks all this is swell its mcquarrie and erik jendresens screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed raising a quizzical eyebrow and some other facets are impacted in turnfrom the outset the premise involving supersmart artificial intelligence brings to mind numerous abject scifi flicks of the past from the terminator and demon seed to bmovies of the 50s after fallout so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props it seems strange for dead reckoning to fully embrace them granted its not as if ethan hunt is facing off against cyborgs and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist but its a sharp turn for the series and its definitely not just about the hitech gadgetry i do have to ask is it just me is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time there are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavyhanded practically browbeating us with the dialogue and scene writing as a prime example look to one of the earliest scenes where mcquarrie and jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape describe ethan hunt as if he were a comic book superhero and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels there are the flashbacks not fully fleshed out and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as mi6 had then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy  watch for the action sequence just after the onehour mark or a late shot of an actor having their william shatner screaming khan moment  or that are very nearly so parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for keaton or chaplin elsewhere the writing is weirdly selfparodying as if dead reckoning were a deadpan sendup a la john carpenters ghosts of mars with this latter quality in mind some odds and ends dont come off so well some overzealous cinematography or editing a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence some otherwise artistic shot composition how the female characters are written and more mcquarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self what happened hereplease understand i do enjoy this movie so much about it looks and sounds superb the cast is splendid and i believe in this case the women all given only supporting parts rather outshine their male costars i look forward to seeing more from hayley atwell who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle rebecca ferguson needs no introduction nor vanessa kirby and kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around pom klementieff to my delight might be one of the top highlights here as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold vicious paris while the writing and in turn mcquarries direction and oversight of the whole lends to some tidbits that i find questionable the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable why though the details are less surefooted and open to dissection the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid ill even go so far as to say that i  someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly exactly or more than three hours long  think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly and meaningfully necessitate another fulllength feature to finish the plot i might even hope that once the eighth mission impossible is released it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms i have now may be somewhat temperedits just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior dead reckoning  for all its splendor as a production  feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different some with more success than others the overall vibe i have with this comes closest to matching those i have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011s ghost protocol solidly made and overall enjoyable but imperfect not as outwardly grabbing troubled by issues with the writing and less certain to demand viewership once or to inspire a second viewing im glad for those who get more out of this picture than i do we all have our personal preferences for my money excellent as it may be in many ways in some critical ones the latest mission impossible comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive check it out by all means if its an action flick you want its an action flick youll get dead reckoning just doesnt have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren and to me therein lies the problem,Positive
"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition. Show, don't tell, seems to have been forgotten.It's like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look like.Paint by numbers, but with film making.The action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise, well done, high octane and professional.There isn't anything wrong with the acting either. It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

But it is all to improbable and even if it could happen irl, it has been done before, but in a better fashion.I wonder what part 2 will bring; to paraphrase Waldorf & Statler: ""probably stuff that was not good enough for the first one.""",i would have loved to enjoy this meeting but i simply could notin prior mi installments there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling but this time i concur with someone who wrote earlier in a review that the story is soulless and emptyi found it a string of reprised sheer impossible action scènes stringed together by an excuse of a story line that made me feel like i missed the first half hour in which the stage was set  as such i never got invested in the storyand it is not that there was not enough time to tell a story as we will most likely get a part 2 tooi get that this is an action movie and not a documentary but it is all to improbable and even if it could happen irl it has been done before but in a better fashioni wonder what part 2 will bring to paraphrase waldorf  statler probably stuff that was not good enough for the first one,Positive
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative
"I would have loved to enjoy this meeting but I simply could not.In prior M:I installments, there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling. But this time, I concur with someone who wrote earlier in a review that the story is soulless and empty.I found it a string of reprised sheer impossible action scènes stringed together by an excuse of a story line that made me feel like I missed the first half hour in which the stage was set - as such, I never got invested in the story.And it is not that there was not enough time to tell a story as we will most likely get a part 2 too.I get that this is an action movie and not a documentary.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

progenitor and 2011s ghost protocol solidly made and overall enjoyable but imperfect not as outwardly grabbing troubled by issues with the writing and less certain to demand viewership once or to inspire a second viewing im glad for those who get more out of this picture than i do we all have our personal preferences for my money excellent as it may be in many ways in some critical ones the latest mission impossible comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive check it out by all means if its an action flick you want its an action flick youll get dead reckoning just doesnt have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren and to me therein lies the problem,Positive
"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition. Show, don't tell, seems to have been forgotten.It's like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look like.Paint by numbers, but with film making.The action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise, well done, high octane and professional.There isn't anything wrong with the acting either. It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them. When you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldn't be a need for a part two, but its all set up for that to happen and it's fair to say I will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensAs per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen , very similar to the James Bond films.",beautiful locations with beautiful women and plenty of action but is that enoughprobably not with a pretty absurd plot and tom cruise starting to show his age yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them when you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldnt be a need for a part two but its all set up for that to happen and its fair to say i will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensas per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen  very similar to the james bond films,Positive

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a series that ive missed much of in the first place ever since the first sequel given the chance to watch all of tom cruises mission impossible films though my curiosity got the best of me and im happy to say it was rewarded much more than not all of them have been pretty enjoyable in one measure or another theres inconsistency from one title to the next and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends theres not really any going wrong here all the same its fair to wonder how cruise and returning filmmaker christopher mcquarrie could follow up 2018s fallout which while still not my personal favorite that would be 2006s mi3 was surely the most polished focused and balanced up to this point not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next how does dead reckoning stack up compared to its forebears to be honest i find myself surprised i do like this seventh feature and it more or less fits in with its kin but in my opinion its an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessorfor as much as fallout was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity its writing not least i dont think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case dont get me wrong in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work from a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that its genuinely pleasing and much the same goes for the sound design i love lorne balfes dynamic score even as  contrary to a few years before  it borrows more from lalo schifrins original theme and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast the stunts practical effects fight scenes and otherwise action sequences the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time are utterly outstanding the computer generated imagery thats used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could though as ever the more we see of it the worse it looks all this is swell its mcquarrie and erik jendresens screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed raising a quizzical eyebrow and some other facets are impacted in turnfrom the outset the premise involving supersmart artificial intelligence brings to mind numerous abject scifi flicks of the past from the terminator and demon seed to bmovies of the 50s after fallout so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props it seems strange for dead reckoning to fully embrace them granted its not as if ethan hunt is facing off against cyborgs and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist but its a sharp turn for the series and its definitely not just about the hitech gadgetry i do have to ask is it just me is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time there are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavyhanded practically browbeating us with the dialogue and scene writing as a prime example look to one of the earliest scenes where mcquarrie and jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape describe ethan hunt as if he were a comic book superhero and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels there are the flashbacks not fully fleshed out and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as mi6 had then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag.

"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner. Just another day at the office, folks.",in the latest installment of how many times can tom cruise defy age mission impossible  dead reckoning takes the cake or should we say the cruciform key this time around ethan hunt played by the man who apparently sips from the fountain of youth embarks on a journey that makes the da vinci code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox the plot thickens faster than a bowl of dayold oatmeal as hunt chases after a nextgen russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue ai  because apparently whats a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypsethe imf teams globetrotting adventure takes us from the empty quarter of the arabian desert to a highstakes party in venice thats so extravagant even the kardashians would pause along the way hunt and his squad including the evercharming benji dunn and luther stickell dodge betrayals impersonate partygoers and grapple with a villainous ai thats moodier than a teenager denied wifi the action scenes are so intense youll find yourself clutching your popcorn like its the last lifeboat on the titanic especially during the climactic traintop tussle that redefines mind the gapethan hunts moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and doublecrosses all while maintaining that signature run weve come to know and love mission impossible  dead reckoning delivers a cocktail of thrills spills and a plot so convoluted it could make a gps unit sob in the end its a 45star rollercoaster that proves once again no mission is too impossible for ethan hunt especially if it involves saving the world before dinner just another day at the office folks,Negative
"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face.

Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them. When you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldn't be a need for a part two, but its all set up for that to happen and it's fair to say I will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensAs per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen , very similar to the James Bond films.",beautiful locations with beautiful women and plenty of action but is that enoughprobably not with a pretty absurd plot and tom cruise starting to show his age yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them when you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldnt be a need for a part two but its all set up for that to happen and its fair to say i will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensas per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen  very similar to the james bond films,Positive

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a series that ive missed much of in the first place ever since the first sequel given the chance to watch all of tom cruises mission impossible films though my curiosity got the best of me and im happy to say it was rewarded much more than not all of them have been pretty enjoyable in one measure or another theres inconsistency from one title to the next and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends theres not really any going wrong here all the same its fair to wonder how cruise and returning filmmaker christopher mcquarrie could follow up 2018s fallout which while still not my personal favorite that would be 2006s mi3 was surely the most polished focused and balanced up to this point not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next how does dead reckoning stack up compared to its forebears to be honest i find myself surprised i do like this seventh feature and it more or less fits in with its kin but in my opinion its an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessorfor as much as fallout was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity its writing not least i dont think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case dont get me wrong in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work from a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that its genuinely pleasing and much the same goes for the sound design i love lorne balfes dynamic score even as  contrary to a few years before  it borrows more from lalo schifrins original theme and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast the stunts practical effects fight scenes and otherwise action sequences the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time are utterly outstanding the computer generated imagery thats used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could though as ever the more we see of it the worse it looks all this is swell its mcquarrie and erik jendresens screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed raising a quizzical eyebrow and some other facets are impacted in turnfrom the outset the premise involving supersmart artificial intelligence brings to mind numerous abject scifi flicks of the past from the terminator and demon seed to bmovies of the 50s after fallout so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props it seems strange for dead reckoning to fully embrace them granted its not as if ethan hunt is facing off against cyborgs and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist but its a sharp turn for the series and its definitely not just about the hitech gadgetry i do have to ask is it just me is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time there are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavyhanded practically browbeating us with the dialogue and scene writing as a prime example look to one of the earliest scenes where mcquarrie and jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape describe ethan hunt as if he were a comic book superhero and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels there are the flashbacks not fully fleshed out and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as mi6 had then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy  watch for the action sequence just after the onehour mark or a late shot of an actor having their william shatner screaming khan moment  or that are very nearly so parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for keaton or chaplin elsewhere the writing is weirdly selfparodying as if dead reckoning were a deadpan sendup a la john carpenters ghosts of mars with this latter quality in mind some odds and ends dont come off so well some overzealous cinematography or editing a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence some otherwise artistic shot composition how the female characters are written and more mcquarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self what happened hereplease understand i do enjoy this movie so much about it looks and sounds superb the cast is splendid and i believe in this case the women all given only supporting parts rather outshine their male costars i look forward to seeing more from hayley atwell who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle rebecca ferguson needs no introduction nor vanessa kirby and kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around pom klementieff to my delight might be one of the top highlights here as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold vicious paris while the writing and in turn mcquarries direction and oversight of the whole lends to some tidbits that i find questionable the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable why though the details are less surefooted and open to dissection the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid ill even go so far as to say that i  someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly exactly or more than three hours long  think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly and

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains?

I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws.

strap in for a wild ride but dont expect a masterpiece mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers on its promise of action with adrenalinepumping sequences that will leave you breathless however the films complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choiceskeeping track of the players the large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention youll need to remember whos who and their motivations which can be challenging especially during the films fastpaced momentscar chases with diminishing returns while the action sequences are impressive particularly the motorcycle chase through rome some car chases feel unnecessarily long dragging down the films momentumpushing the boundaries of believability the mission impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible but even for this series some moments stretch credulity too far venice usually teeming with tourists appears eerily empty pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limitsvisually stunning but not oscarworthy the special effects are undeniably impressive but the film relies heavily on them sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development while technically proficient the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experienceoverall mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a fun actionpacked ride but its not without its flaws if youre looking for a mindbending thriller you might be disappointed however if you crave heartstopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure this film delivers",Negative
"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

not least i dont think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case dont get me wrong in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work from a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that its genuinely pleasing and much the same goes for the sound design i love lorne balfes dynamic score even as  contrary to a few years before  it borrows more from lalo schifrins original theme and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast the stunts practical effects fight scenes and otherwise action sequences the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time are utterly outstanding the computer generated imagery thats used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could though as ever the more we see of it the worse it looks all this is swell its mcquarrie and erik jendresens screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed raising a quizzical eyebrow and some other facets are impacted in turnfrom the outset the premise involving supersmart artificial intelligence brings to mind numerous abject scifi flicks of the past from the terminator and demon seed to bmovies of the 50s after fallout so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props it seems strange for dead reckoning to fully embrace them granted its not as if ethan hunt is facing off against cyborgs and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist but its a sharp turn for the series and its definitely not just about the hitech gadgetry i do have to ask is it just me is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time there are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavyhanded practically browbeating us with the dialogue and scene writing as a prime example look to one of the earliest scenes where mcquarrie and jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape describe ethan hunt as if he were a comic book superhero and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels there are the flashbacks not fully fleshed out and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as mi6 had then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy  watch for the action sequence just after the onehour mark or a late shot of an actor having their william shatner screaming khan moment  or that are very nearly so parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for keaton or chaplin elsewhere the writing is weirdly selfparodying as if dead reckoning were a deadpan sendup a la john carpenters ghosts of mars with this latter quality in mind some odds and ends dont come off so well some overzealous cinematography or editing a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence some otherwise artistic shot composition how the female characters are written and more mcquarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self what happened hereplease understand i do enjoy this movie so much about it looks and sounds superb the cast is splendid and i believe in this case the women all given only supporting parts rather outshine their male costars i look forward to seeing more from hayley atwell who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle rebecca ferguson needs no introduction nor vanessa kirby and kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around pom klementieff to my delight might be one of the top highlights here as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold vicious paris while the writing and in turn mcquarries direction and oversight of the whole lends to some tidbits that i find questionable the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable why though the details are less surefooted and open to dissection the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid ill even go so far as to say that i  someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly exactly or more than three hours long  think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly and meaningfully necessitate another fulllength feature to finish the plot i might even hope that once the eighth mission impossible is released it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms i have now may be somewhat temperedits just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior dead reckoning  for all its splendor as a production  feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different some with more success than others the overall vibe i have with this comes closest to matching those i have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011s ghost protocol solidly made and overall enjoyable but imperfect not as outwardly grabbing troubled by issues with the writing and less certain to demand viewership once or to inspire a second viewing im glad for those who get more out of this picture than i do we all have our personal preferences for my money excellent as it may be in many ways in some critical ones the latest mission impossible comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive check it out by all means if its an action flick you want its an action flick youll get dead reckoning just doesnt have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren and to me therein lies the problem,Positive
"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition. Show, don't tell, seems to have been forgotten.It's like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look like.Paint by numbers, but with film making.The action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise, well done, high octane and professional.There isn't anything wrong with the acting either. It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

But it is all to improbable and even if it could happen irl, it has been done before, but in a better fashion.I wonder what part 2 will bring; to paraphrase Waldorf & Statler: ""probably stuff that was not good enough for the first one.""",i would have loved to enjoy this meeting but i simply could notin prior mi installments there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling but this time i concur with someone who wrote earlier in a review that the story is soulless and emptyi found it a string of reprised sheer impossible action scènes stringed together by an excuse of a story line that made me feel like i missed the first half hour in which the stage was set  as such i never got invested in the storyand it is not that there was not enough time to tell a story as we will most likely get a part 2 tooi get that this is an action movie and not a documentary but it is all to improbable and even if it could happen irl it has been done before but in a better fashioni wonder what part 2 will bring to paraphrase waldorf  statler probably stuff that was not good enough for the first one,Positive
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative
"I would have loved to enjoy this meeting but I simply could not.In prior M:I installments, there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling. But this time, I concur with someone who wrote earlier in a review that the story is soulless and empty.I found it a string of reprised sheer impossible action scènes stringed together by an excuse of a story line that made me feel like I missed the first half hour in which the stage was set - as such, I never got invested in the story.And it is not that there was not enough time to tell a story as we will most likely get a part 2 too.I get that this is an action movie and not a documentary.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

progenitor and 2011s ghost protocol solidly made and overall enjoyable but imperfect not as outwardly grabbing troubled by issues with the writing and less certain to demand viewership once or to inspire a second viewing im glad for those who get more out of this picture than i do we all have our personal preferences for my money excellent as it may be in many ways in some critical ones the latest mission impossible comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive check it out by all means if its an action flick you want its an action flick youll get dead reckoning just doesnt have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren and to me therein lies the problem,Positive
"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition. Show, don't tell, seems to have been forgotten.It's like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look like.Paint by numbers, but with film making.The action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise, well done, high octane and professional.There isn't anything wrong with the acting either. It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them. When you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldn't be a need for a part two, but its all set up for that to happen and it's fair to say I will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensAs per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen , very similar to the James Bond films.",beautiful locations with beautiful women and plenty of action but is that enoughprobably not with a pretty absurd plot and tom cruise starting to show his age yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them when you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldnt be a need for a part two but its all set up for that to happen and its fair to say i will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensas per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen  very similar to the james bond films,Positive

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a series that ive missed much of in the first place ever since the first sequel given the chance to watch all of tom cruises mission impossible films though my curiosity got the best of me and im happy to say it was rewarded much more than not all of them have been pretty enjoyable in one measure or another theres inconsistency from one title to the next and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends theres not really any going wrong here all the same its fair to wonder how cruise and returning filmmaker christopher mcquarrie could follow up 2018s fallout which while still not my personal favorite that would be 2006s mi3 was surely the most polished focused and balanced up to this point not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next how does dead reckoning stack up compared to its forebears to be honest i find myself surprised i do like this seventh feature and it more or less fits in with its kin but in my opinion its an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessorfor as much as fallout was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity its writing not least i dont think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case dont get me wrong in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work from a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that its genuinely pleasing and much the same goes for the sound design i love lorne balfes dynamic score even as  contrary to a few years before  it borrows more from lalo schifrins original theme and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast the stunts practical effects fight scenes and otherwise action sequences the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time are utterly outstanding the computer generated imagery thats used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could though as ever the more we see of it the worse it looks all this is swell its mcquarrie and erik jendresens screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed raising a quizzical eyebrow and some other facets are impacted in turnfrom the outset the premise involving supersmart artificial intelligence brings to mind numerous abject scifi flicks of the past from the terminator and demon seed to bmovies of the 50s after fallout so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props it seems strange for dead reckoning to fully embrace them granted its not as if ethan hunt is facing off against cyborgs and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist but its a sharp turn for the series and its definitely not just about the hitech gadgetry i do have to ask is it just me is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time there are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavyhanded practically browbeating us with the dialogue and scene writing as a prime example look to one of the earliest scenes where mcquarrie and jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape describe ethan hunt as if he were a comic book superhero and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels there are the flashbacks not fully fleshed out and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as mi6 had then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag.

"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner. Just another day at the office, folks.",in the latest installment of how many times can tom cruise defy age mission impossible  dead reckoning takes the cake or should we say the cruciform key this time around ethan hunt played by the man who apparently sips from the fountain of youth embarks on a journey that makes the da vinci code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox the plot thickens faster than a bowl of dayold oatmeal as hunt chases after a nextgen russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue ai  because apparently whats a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypsethe imf teams globetrotting adventure takes us from the empty quarter of the arabian desert to a highstakes party in venice thats so extravagant even the kardashians would pause along the way hunt and his squad including the evercharming benji dunn and luther stickell dodge betrayals impersonate partygoers and grapple with a villainous ai thats moodier than a teenager denied wifi the action scenes are so intense youll find yourself clutching your popcorn like its the last lifeboat on the titanic especially during the climactic traintop tussle that redefines mind the gapethan hunts moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and doublecrosses all while maintaining that signature run weve come to know and love mission impossible  dead reckoning delivers a cocktail of thrills spills and a plot so convoluted it could make a gps unit sob in the end its a 45star rollercoaster that proves once again no mission is too impossible for ethan hunt especially if it involves saving the world before dinner just another day at the office folks,Negative
"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face.

Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them. When you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldn't be a need for a part two, but its all set up for that to happen and it's fair to say I will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensAs per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen , very similar to the James Bond films.",beautiful locations with beautiful women and plenty of action but is that enoughprobably not with a pretty absurd plot and tom cruise starting to show his age yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them when you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldnt be a need for a part two but its all set up for that to happen and its fair to say i will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensas per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen  very similar to the james bond films,Positive

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a series that ive missed much of in the first place ever since the first sequel given the chance to watch all of tom cruises mission impossible films though my curiosity got the best of me and im happy to say it was rewarded much more than not all of them have been pretty enjoyable in one measure or another theres inconsistency from one title to the next and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends theres not really any going wrong here all the same its fair to wonder how cruise and returning filmmaker christopher mcquarrie could follow up 2018s fallout which while still not my personal favorite that would be 2006s mi3 was surely the most polished focused and balanced up to this point not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next how does dead reckoning stack up compared to its forebears to be honest i find myself surprised i do like this seventh feature and it more or less fits in with its kin but in my opinion its an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessorfor as much as fallout was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity its writing not least i dont think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case dont get me wrong in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work from a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that its genuinely pleasing and much the same goes for the sound design i love lorne balfes dynamic score even as  contrary to a few years before  it borrows more from lalo schifrins original theme and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast the stunts practical effects fight scenes and otherwise action sequences the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time are utterly outstanding the computer generated imagery thats used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could though as ever the more we see of it the worse it looks all this is swell its mcquarrie and erik jendresens screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed raising a quizzical eyebrow and some other facets are impacted in turnfrom the outset the premise involving supersmart artificial intelligence brings to mind numerous abject scifi flicks of the past from the terminator and demon seed to bmovies of the 50s after fallout so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props it seems strange for dead reckoning to fully embrace them granted its not as if ethan hunt is facing off against cyborgs and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist but its a sharp turn for the series and its definitely not just about the hitech gadgetry i do have to ask is it just me is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time there are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavyhanded practically browbeating us with the dialogue and scene writing as a prime example look to one of the earliest scenes where mcquarrie and jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape describe ethan hunt as if he were a comic book superhero and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels there are the flashbacks not fully fleshed out and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as mi6 had then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy  watch for the action sequence just after the onehour mark or a late shot of an actor having their william shatner screaming khan moment  or that are very nearly so parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for keaton or chaplin elsewhere the writing is weirdly selfparodying as if dead reckoning were a deadpan sendup a la john carpenters ghosts of mars with this latter quality in mind some odds and ends dont come off so well some overzealous cinematography or editing a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence some otherwise artistic shot composition how the female characters are written and more mcquarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self what happened hereplease understand i do enjoy this movie so much about it looks and sounds superb the cast is splendid and i believe in this case the women all given only supporting parts rather outshine their male costars i look forward to seeing more from hayley atwell who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle rebecca ferguson needs no introduction nor vanessa kirby and kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around pom klementieff to my delight might be one of the top highlights here as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold vicious paris while the writing and in turn mcquarries direction and oversight of the whole lends to some tidbits that i find questionable the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable why though the details are less surefooted and open to dissection the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid ill even go so far as to say that i  someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly exactly or more than three hours long  think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly and

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains?

I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws.

strap in for a wild ride but dont expect a masterpiece mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers on its promise of action with adrenalinepumping sequences that will leave you breathless however the films complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choiceskeeping track of the players the large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention youll need to remember whos who and their motivations which can be challenging especially during the films fastpaced momentscar chases with diminishing returns while the action sequences are impressive particularly the motorcycle chase through rome some car chases feel unnecessarily long dragging down the films momentumpushing the boundaries of believability the mission impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible but even for this series some moments stretch credulity too far venice usually teeming with tourists appears eerily empty pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limitsvisually stunning but not oscarworthy the special effects are undeniably impressive but the film relies heavily on them sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development while technically proficient the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experienceoverall mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a fun actionpacked ride but its not without its flaws if youre looking for a mindbending thriller you might be disappointed however if you crave heartstopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure this film delivers",Negative
"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

not least i dont think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case dont get me wrong in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work from a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that its genuinely pleasing and much the same goes for the sound design i love lorne balfes dynamic score even as  contrary to a few years before  it borrows more from lalo schifrins original theme and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast the stunts practical effects fight scenes and otherwise action sequences the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time are utterly outstanding the computer generated imagery thats used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could though as ever the more we see of it the worse it looks all this is swell its mcquarrie and erik jendresens screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed raising a quizzical eyebrow and some other facets are impacted in turnfrom the outset the premise involving supersmart artificial intelligence brings to mind numerous abject scifi flicks of the past from the terminator and demon seed to bmovies of the 50s after fallout so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props it seems strange for dead reckoning to fully embrace them granted its not as if ethan hunt is facing off against cyborgs and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist but its a sharp turn for the series and its definitely not just about the hitech gadgetry i do have to ask is it just me is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time there are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavyhanded practically browbeating us with the dialogue and scene writing as a prime example look to one of the earliest scenes where mcquarrie and jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape describe ethan hunt as if he were a comic book superhero and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels there are the flashbacks not fully fleshed out and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as mi6 had then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy  watch for the action sequence just after the onehour mark or a late shot of an actor having their william shatner screaming khan moment  or that are very nearly so parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for keaton or chaplin elsewhere the writing is weirdly selfparodying as if dead reckoning were a deadpan sendup a la john carpenters ghosts of mars with this latter quality in mind some odds and ends dont come off so well some overzealous cinematography or editing a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence some otherwise artistic shot composition how the female characters are written and more mcquarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self what happened hereplease understand i do enjoy this movie so much about it looks and sounds superb the cast is splendid and i believe in this case the women all given only supporting parts rather outshine their male costars i look forward to seeing more from hayley atwell who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle rebecca ferguson needs no introduction nor vanessa kirby and kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around pom klementieff to my delight might be one of the top highlights here as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold vicious paris while the writing and in turn mcquarries direction and oversight of the whole lends to some tidbits that i find questionable the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable why though the details are less surefooted and open to dissection the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid ill even go so far as to say that i  someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly exactly or more than three hours long  think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly and meaningfully necessitate another fulllength feature to finish the plot i might even hope that once the eighth mission impossible is released it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms i have now may be somewhat temperedits just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior dead reckoning  for all its splendor as a production  feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different some with more success than others the overall vibe i have with this comes closest to matching those i have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011s ghost protocol solidly made and overall enjoyable but imperfect not as outwardly grabbing troubled by issues with the writing and less certain to demand viewership once or to inspire a second viewing im glad for those who get more out of this picture than i do we all have our personal preferences for my money excellent as it may be in many ways in some critical ones the latest mission impossible comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive check it out by all means if its an action flick you want its an action flick youll get dead reckoning just doesnt have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren and to me therein lies the problem,Positive
"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition. Show, don't tell, seems to have been forgotten.It's like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look like.Paint by numbers, but with film making.The action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise, well done, high octane and professional.There isn't anything wrong with the acting either. It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

But it is all to improbable and even if it could happen irl, it has been done before, but in a better fashion.I wonder what part 2 will bring; to paraphrase Waldorf & Statler: ""probably stuff that was not good enough for the first one.""",i would have loved to enjoy this meeting but i simply could notin prior mi installments there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling but this time i concur with someone who wrote earlier in a review that the story is soulless and emptyi found it a string of reprised sheer impossible action scènes stringed together by an excuse of a story line that made me feel like i missed the first half hour in which the stage was set  as such i never got invested in the storyand it is not that there was not enough time to tell a story as we will most likely get a part 2 tooi get that this is an action movie and not a documentary but it is all to improbable and even if it could happen irl it has been done before but in a better fashioni wonder what part 2 will bring to paraphrase waldorf  statler probably stuff that was not good enough for the first one,Positive
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative
"I would have loved to enjoy this meeting but I simply could not.In prior M:I installments, there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling. But this time, I concur with someone who wrote earlier in a review that the story is soulless and empty.I found it a string of reprised sheer impossible action scènes stringed together by an excuse of a story line that made me feel like I missed the first half hour in which the stage was set - as such, I never got invested in the story.And it is not that there was not enough time to tell a story as we will most likely get a part 2 too.I get that this is an action movie and not a documentary.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

progenitor and 2011s ghost protocol solidly made and overall enjoyable but imperfect not as outwardly grabbing troubled by issues with the writing and less certain to demand viewership once or to inspire a second viewing im glad for those who get more out of this picture than i do we all have our personal preferences for my money excellent as it may be in many ways in some critical ones the latest mission impossible comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive check it out by all means if its an action flick you want its an action flick youll get dead reckoning just doesnt have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren and to me therein lies the problem,Positive
"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition. Show, don't tell, seems to have been forgotten.It's like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look like.Paint by numbers, but with film making.The action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise, well done, high octane and professional.There isn't anything wrong with the acting either. It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them. When you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldn't be a need for a part two, but its all set up for that to happen and it's fair to say I will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensAs per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen , very similar to the James Bond films.",beautiful locations with beautiful women and plenty of action but is that enoughprobably not with a pretty absurd plot and tom cruise starting to show his age yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them when you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldnt be a need for a part two but its all set up for that to happen and its fair to say i will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensas per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen  very similar to the james bond films,Positive

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a series that ive missed much of in the first place ever since the first sequel given the chance to watch all of tom cruises mission impossible films though my curiosity got the best of me and im happy to say it was rewarded much more than not all of them have been pretty enjoyable in one measure or another theres inconsistency from one title to the next and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends theres not really any going wrong here all the same its fair to wonder how cruise and returning filmmaker christopher mcquarrie could follow up 2018s fallout which while still not my personal favorite that would be 2006s mi3 was surely the most polished focused and balanced up to this point not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next how does dead reckoning stack up compared to its forebears to be honest i find myself surprised i do like this seventh feature and it more or less fits in with its kin but in my opinion its an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessorfor as much as fallout was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity its writing not least i dont think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case dont get me wrong in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work from a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that its genuinely pleasing and much the same goes for the sound design i love lorne balfes dynamic score even as  contrary to a few years before  it borrows more from lalo schifrins original theme and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast the stunts practical effects fight scenes and otherwise action sequences the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time are utterly outstanding the computer generated imagery thats used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could though as ever the more we see of it the worse it looks all this is swell its mcquarrie and erik jendresens screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed raising a quizzical eyebrow and some other facets are impacted in turnfrom the outset the premise involving supersmart artificial intelligence brings to mind numerous abject scifi flicks of the past from the terminator and demon seed to bmovies of the 50s after fallout so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props it seems strange for dead reckoning to fully embrace them granted its not as if ethan hunt is facing off against cyborgs and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist but its a sharp turn for the series and its definitely not just about the hitech gadgetry i do have to ask is it just me is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time there are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavyhanded practically browbeating us with the dialogue and scene writing as a prime example look to one of the earliest scenes where mcquarrie and jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape describe ethan hunt as if he were a comic book superhero and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels there are the flashbacks not fully fleshed out and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as mi6 had then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face. No matter how one enjoys the production, the scenery, the score, the script is just far too silly for words. Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead. I felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel. I would rate this as the worst MI movie, such a shame and a disappointment.",the script is just awful all full of portentousdoomladen pseudo biblical nonsense and i think the entity is talked about around a 100 times 99 times too many to keep a straight face no matter how one enjoys the production the scenery the score the script is just far too silly for words everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and i have no idea why so much screen time is given to haley atwell shes just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of rebecca ferguson i found atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast and oh my heavens this is script that should have died in writers 101 its just dead i felt sorry for the actors having to spew such semi literate drivel i would rate this as the worst mi movie such a shame and a disappointment,Negative

"Won't say anything other that Ilsa's demise ruined the franchise for me and also, why is it that many of the powerful women equal to powerful men get killed off in Hollywood movies. Anyway, that's just an opinion but did not appreciate it. I read somewhere that this made sense to the story, aka Ethan running around to save two women because one had to die?? Like...what? No, just no, writers can do better than that instead of throwing around such a cheap trope for the ""emotional"" growth of the main hero. That does not take away from the fact that Ilsa's character was also damaged prior to this movie by a silly inclusion in Ethan's team.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise. Very disappointed.",when mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting the stunts the gadgets everything its like a new gen 007 but as the year go by the story is becoming repetitive and ethan hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous as a agent thats supposed to save the world ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends so every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative the only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise very disappointed,Positive

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag.

"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner. Just another day at the office, folks.",in the latest installment of how many times can tom cruise defy age mission impossible  dead reckoning takes the cake or should we say the cruciform key this time around ethan hunt played by the man who apparently sips from the fountain of youth embarks on a journey that makes the da vinci code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox the plot thickens faster than a bowl of dayold oatmeal as hunt chases after a nextgen russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue ai  because apparently whats a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypsethe imf teams globetrotting adventure takes us from the empty quarter of the arabian desert to a highstakes party in venice thats so extravagant even the kardashians would pause along the way hunt and his squad including the evercharming benji dunn and luther stickell dodge betrayals impersonate partygoers and grapple with a villainous ai thats moodier than a teenager denied wifi the action scenes are so intense youll find yourself clutching your popcorn like its the last lifeboat on the titanic especially during the climactic traintop tussle that redefines mind the gapethan hunts moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and doublecrosses all while maintaining that signature run weve come to know and love mission impossible  dead reckoning delivers a cocktail of thrills spills and a plot so convoluted it could make a gps unit sob in the end its a 45star rollercoaster that proves once again no mission is too impossible for ethan hunt especially if it involves saving the world before dinner just another day at the office folks,Negative
"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are. The stunts look okay-ish but so much is digital that it just doesn't feel real and is more like a playstation game (mad max fury road just did this stuff so much better).Plot is nonsensical. The entity idea is beyond abysmal. I mean absolutely awful. And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"TLDR; Just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal exposition.Easily an hour too long, mostly through the pointless exposition.

It's what you expect.But the material they are working with is poor, the direction and editing needed to be harder and slicker.By far the worst film in the franchise.",tldr just a series of high octane set pieces vaguely linked by way too much verbal expositioneasily an hour too long mostly through the pointless exposition show dont tell seems to have been forgottenits like watching a corporate presentation of what a mission impossible film should look likepaint by numbers but with film makingthe action sequences are everything you expect from the franchise well done high octane and professionalthere isnt anything wrong with the acting either its what you expectbut the material they are working with is poor the direction and editing needed to be harder and slickerby far the worst film in the franchise,Negative
"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them.

"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive

"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses

"Could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a top-notch action flic.Grace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train. But thanks God that there is Ethan Hunt! He managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train. For sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to Grace and knocks him down without effort. For me the most realistic and best timed scene ever. It was splendid, it deserves an own category at the Golden Rapsberry Awards.Actually, the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the Arabian Desert. The chase at Abu Dhabi Airport was well-performed and the plot quite decent until this moment. After this point the movie loses its grip. The hunt in Rome was too CGI driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain. And about the ridiculous final scene in the Alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review. Thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10. But I hope the second part delivers.",could be so much better but one scene ruined the whole the movie to be a topnotch action flicgrace is the threatened by a gunman on a moving train but thanks god that there is ethan hunt he managed to jump with a parachute from a mountain and reaches easily the moving train for sure he exactly lands in the carriage where the guy points his gun to grace and knocks him down without effort for me the most realistic and best timed scene ever it was splendid it deserves an own category at the golden rapsberry awardsactually the movie started quite intense with the scene in the submarine and the situation in the arabian desert the chase at abu dhabi airport was wellperformed and the plot quite decent until this moment after this point the movie loses its grip the hunt in rome was too cgi driven and many coincidences lead to a successful escape from the villain and about the ridiculous final scene in the alps is nothing more to add than in the beginning of this review thanks to the great first half this movie it gets a pretty good 7 out of 10 but i hope the second part delivers,Positive
"The script is just awful. All full of portentous,doom-laden, pseudo- biblical nonsense and I think the ""entity"" is talked about around a 100 times. 99 times too many to keep a straight face.

Everyone has to work with terrible dialogue and I have no idea why so much screen time is given to Haley Atwell. She's just an ordinary bit part player and not one tenth of one percent of the charisma and character of Rebecca Ferguson. I found Atwell to be silly and superficial and not up to the calibre of the usual cast. And oh my heavens, this is script that should have died in writers 101, it's just ....dead.

"When mission impossible was first introduced it was refreshing and exciting, the stunts the gadgets everything, it's like a new gen 007. But as the year go by, the story is becoming repetitive and Ethan Hunt became some sort of messiah and movie logic became very horrendous. As a agent that's supposed to save the world, Ethan hunt risked the world multiple times for his personal relationship like his friends. So every single of the prequels are always the same crew and the gadgets and tricks are just so similar and uncreative. The only thing that made mission impossible watchable right now are the stunts, other than that it just turned into some kind of fast and furious franchise.

"An soulless, empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked, overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked, overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation (& plot) is.Tom Cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the movie.His team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen, is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happening.The new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies; and there's an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working for.I reckon Part 2 will be just as woeful.",an soulless empty 2hr 43min which consists of a series of overworked overlong and repetitive action sequences interspersed with overworked overlong and drawn out scenes of the characters talking about how complex and bad the situation  plot istom cruise just looked tired and bored throughout the entire slog of the moviehis team mates have little purpose other than to over explain everything that may happen is going to happen or what they will have to do to stop something from happeningthe new cast members are either pointless or stereotypes of the usual characters seen in these movies and theres an antagonist who thinks and acts like a robot assumingly because of who he is working fori reckon part 2 will be just as woeful,Negative
"With the seventh chapter of the Mission Impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself, both from the point of view of the characters, the direction and the narration. From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.",with the seventh chapter of the mission impossible saga we are taken back a little to what were the beginnings of the saga itself both from the point of view of the characters the direction and the narration from a directorial point of view in particular christopher mcquarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenalinefilled way nonetheless however the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of brian de palma already director of the first chapter and the insistent use of dutch angles and closeups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice from a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment the choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time nonetheless the movie is in no way boring and the stunts which are now an integral part of what elevates the mission impossible saga above the average of other action franchises always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema,Negative

"In recent years I've rather tired of the action blockbuster, and this is a series that I've missed much of in the first place, ever since the first sequel. Given the chance to watch all of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' films, though, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm happy to say it was rewarded much more than not: all of them have been pretty enjoyable, in one measure or another. There's inconsistency from one title to the next, and there are reasonable criticisms to level with even the best of them, but for anyone receptive to what the genre portends, there's not really any going wrong here. All the same, it's fair to wonder how Cruise and returning filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie could follow up 2018's 'Fallout,' which while still not my personal favorite (that would be 2006's MI3) was surely the most polished, focused, and balanced up to this point. Not least recognizing that the big stunts and action sequences only grew from one sequel to the next, how does 'Dead reckoning' stack up compared to its forebears? To be honest, I find myself surprised. I do like this seventh feature, and it more or less fits in with its kin, but in my opinion it's an awkward step backward from its immediate predecessor.For as much as 'Fallout' was ever so carefully crafted in every capacity, its writing not least, I don't think the same supreme judiciousness was fully applied in this case. Don't get me wrong, in terms of production values this reflects the very best of modern cinema, and every single person in front of the camera and behind the scenes turned in impeccable work. From a fundamental standpoint of the visual experience the picture is so vibrant that it's genuinely pleasing, and much the same goes for the sound design. I love Lorne Balfe's dynamic score even as - contrary to a few years before - it borrows more from Lalo Schifrin's original theme, and the other music selectively used throughout is a blast. The stunts, practical effects, fight scenes, and otherwise action sequences, the keystones of these films since the beginning and only ever more so over time, are utterly outstanding. The computer generated imagery that's used to round out particular sequences looks as good as it could (though as ever, the more we see of it, the worse it looks). All this is swell. It's McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen's screenplay that leaves me a bit unimpressed, raising a quizzical eyebrow, and some other facets are impacted in turn.From the outset the premise, involving super-smart artificial intelligence, brings to mind numerous abject sci-fi flicks of the past, from 'The terminator' and 'Demon seed' to B-movies of the 50s. After 'Fallout' so thoroughly cleansed itself of such trappings aside from a few props, it seems strange for 'Dead reckoning' to fully embrace them. Granted, it's not as if Ethan Hunt is facing off against cyborgs, and there are certainly human elements opposing our protagonist, but it's a sharp turn for the series. And it's definitely not just about the hi-tech gadgetry. I do have to ask: is it just me? Is watching the series back to back to back putting the whole at a disadvantage as they all start to blend together after a time? There are many points at which the writing is decidedly heavy-handed, practically brow-beating us with the dialogue and scene writing. As a prime example, look to one of the earliest scenes, where McQuarrie and Jendresen unflinchingly speak to the calamitous precipice over which our world hangs in real life, speak to the foolhardy arrogance and ignorance with which techbros toy with the digital landscape, describe Ethan Hunt as if he were a comic book superhero, and lay out exposition with all the elegance of a hippopotamus in heels. There are the flashbacks, not fully fleshed out, and the attempts to less convincingly address thoughtful questions as MI6 had. Then there are the instances that exceed the substantial playfulness of other past installments to embrace outright comedy - watch for the action sequence just after the one-hour mark, or a late shot of an actor having their ""William Shatner screaming 'Khan!'"" moment - or that are very nearly so; parts of the last big action sequence are a heartbeat away from being a bit for Keaton or Chaplin. Elsewhere the writing is weirdly self-parodying, as if 'Dead reckoning' were a deadpan send-up a la John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars.' With this latter quality in mind, some odds and ends don't come off so well: some overzealous cinematography or editing, a cartoonish look a character wears for one sequence, some otherwise artistic shot composition, how the female characters are written, and more. McQuarrie very clearly made his best effort as a writer for the 2018 antecedent to be its best self; what happened here?Please understand, I do enjoy this movie. So much about it looks and sounds superb. The cast is splendid, and I believe in this case the women, all given only supporting parts, rather outshine their male co-stars. I look forward to seeing more from Hayley Atwell, who easily holds her own as the most important second fiddle; Rebecca Ferguson needs no introduction, nor Vanessa Kirby, and Kirby in particular is allowed to demonstrate more of her skills this time around. Pom Klementieff, to my delight, might be one of the top highlights here, as she is obviously living her best life in portraying cold, vicious Paris. While the writing, and in turn McQuarrie's direction and oversight of the whole, lends to some tidbits that I find questionable, the contributions in and of themselves are unassailable. Why, though the details are less sure-footed and open to dissection, the foundations in the story and screenplay are solid. I'll even go so far as to say that I - someone who scoffs judgmentally at how so many blockbusters of recent years feel the need to be nearly, exactly, or more than three hours long - think that at its core the narrative is penned so well that these 163 minutes pass quite quickly and smoothly, and meaningfully necessitate another full-length feature to finish the plot. I might even hope that once the eighth 'Mission: Impossible' is released, it will complement the seventh so well that the criticisms I have now may be somewhat tempered.It's just that for a series that seemed to find its true voice five years prior, 'Dead reckoning' - for all its splendor as a production - feels like a throwback to a time when each subsequent installment was trying something a little different, some with more success than others. The overall vibe I have with this comes closest to matching those I have with the 1996 progenitor and 2011's 'Ghost Protocol': solidly made, and overall enjoyable, but imperfect, not as outwardly grabbing, troubled by issues with the writing, and less certain to demand viewership once, or to inspire a second viewing. I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do; we all have our personal preferences. For my money, excellent as it may be in many ways, in some critical ones the latest 'Mission: Impossible' comes up short and a smidgen unimpressive. Check it out, by all means; if it's an action flick you want, it's an action flick you'll get. 'Dead reckoning' just doesn't have its feet planted as firmly as some of its brethren, and to me, therein lies the problem.",in recent years ive rather tired of the action blockbuster and this is a

"""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" delivers the expected high-octane thrills synonymous with the franchise, yet it seems all too familiar. Tom Cruise, as relentless as ever, embodies Ethan Hunt with the same intensity we've come to admire. Yet, this installment feels like it's running on autopilot. The formula is there: breathtaking stunts, globe-trotting adventures, and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible. However, the sense of déjà vu is palpable, making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshed.The movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence, aiming to hook you from the get-go. While it manages to intrigue, the impact doesn't quite hit the mark as previous entries did, lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout. The action sequences, while expertly choreographed and executed, echo previous missions. They're enjoyable, no doubt, but the element of surprise seems to be missing.What's more, the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness. As the credits roll, you're left waiting for a resolution that's yet to come. This approach, arguably a strategic move to build anticipation, feels more like a drawn-out preamble than a necessary division, hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessity.In essence, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the action-packed sequences and the undying charisma of Tom Cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchise's legacy. The movie, while entertaining, doesn't escape the shadow of its predecessors, serving more as a reminder of the series' high points than establishing its own.",mission impossible  dead reckoning part one delivers the expected highoctane thrills synonymous with the franchise yet it seems all too familiar tom cruise as relentless as ever embodies ethan hunt with the same intensity weve come to admire yet this installment feels like its running on autopilot the formula is there breathtaking stunts globetrotting adventures and a plot that teeters on the edge of the incredible however the sense of déjà vu is palpable making the experience feel recycled rather than refreshedthe movie kicks off with its trademark opening sequence aiming to hook you from the getgo while it manages to intrigue the impact doesnt quite hit the mark as previous entries did lacking the depth and novelty that made the series a standout the action sequences while expertly choreographed and executed echo previous missions theyre enjoyable no doubt but the element of surprise seems to be missingwhats more the narrative decision to split the story into two parts leaves a lingering sense of incompleteness as the credits roll youre left waiting for a resolution thats yet to come this approach arguably a strategic move to build anticipation feels more like a drawnout preamble than a necessary division hinting at a commercial strategy rather than a storytelling necessityin essence mission impossible  dead reckoning part one is a mixed bag it delivers the actionpacked sequences and the undying charisma of tom cruise but falls short of offering anything novel to the franchises legacy the movie while entertaining doesnt escape the shadow of its predecessors serving more as a reminder of the series high points than establishing its own,Positive
"In the latest installment of ""How Many Times Can Tom Cruise Defy Age?"", ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" takes the cake, or should we say, the cruciform key. This time around, Ethan Hunt, played by the man who apparently sips from the Fountain of Youth, embarks on a journey that makes the Da Vinci Code look like a treasure hunt in a sandbox. The plot thickens faster than a bowl of day-old oatmeal as Hunt chases after a next-gen Russian stealth submarine controlled by a rogue AI - because, apparently, what's a spy movie without a little cyber apocalypse?The IMF team's globe-trotting adventure takes us from the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to a high-stakes party in Venice that's so extravagant, even the Kardashians would pause. Along the way, Hunt and his squad, including the ever-charming Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, dodge betrayals, impersonate partygoers, and grapple with a villainous AI that's moodier than a teenager denied Wi-Fi. The action scenes are so intense, you'll find yourself clutching your popcorn like it's the last lifeboat on the Titanic, especially during the climactic train-top tussle that redefines ""mind the gap.""Ethan Hunt's moral compass spins wilder than a drunk roulette wheel as he navigates alliances and double-crosses, all while maintaining that signature run we've come to know and love. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"" delivers a cocktail of thrills, spills, and a plot so convoluted it could make a GPS unit sob. In the end, it's a 4.5-star rollercoaster that proves, once again, no mission is too impossible for Ethan Hunt, especially if it involves saving the world before dinner.

"Ok, something very, very, very, very weird happened here. We are talking about Mission Impossible - and it should never EVER be a
movie to take lightly. Why? Because this was and is a so good movie to enjoy with family and Tom Cruise was only getting better BUT: what happened to the script? All actors are good and major in what they do, so why do we watch it as we are watching a joke in SNL? This was not well written and well directed at all. The only scene that was good to watch was when Tom jumped with his motorcycle. The end. There is this HUGE budget, so I think that the least they could've have done was hiring a great screenwriter. Part two should hire a better team to make a better story. Is the only movie of the franchise that has poor writing.","ok something very very very very weird happened here we are talking about mission impossible  and it should never ever be a

"I've loved the MI films - well apart from the 2nd one which was mince. Sadly this one is the worst one yet. Tom looks old, as does Simon pegg (but I guess they are.

And the whole key thing is ludicrous (bad ludicrous, not good ludicrous).The actress playing Grace and the bad guys are completely forgettable.With a 12 rating the fight scenes are tame and there is absolutely no sense of jeopardy.So far fetched, that it's more like a comedy although who doesn't love watching two old guys fighting on top of a pretend runaway train.Here's an idea - stop all the terrible digital effects, pay actual writers to write a decent script and hire some charismatic actors (or even just some good ones).And they nicked the end bit from the uncharted two game.🤦And it is so, so long...and this was just part 1.

"The movie begins with Russian submarine Sevastopol trying to protect itself from the rogue-sentient-military-AI called the ""Entity"". Well, the plot gets predictable right away at the beginning. The story of sentient machine going rogue and a group of ragtag, eccentric people racing against the time, is as old as Isaac Asimov himself.We have seen James Cameron and Wachowski sisters carving entire franchises out of this plot. But I am afraid Christopher McQuarie is 4 decades too late. While Cameron and Wachowskis provided franchises that are visually spellbinding, philosophies that could question the very idea of human civilization and dialogues that could stir your emotions. McQuarie failed to ignite even a small spark inside me.Nevertheless, it is a Tom Cruise movie through and through. It is his screen presence that kept this movie alive for it's almost three hours runtime. The action sequences were pretty basic and nothing extraordinary, I might add that I have seen better choreographed action sequences in Raiders of the lost ark (which came out in 1981). Every other actor apart from Tom Cruise seems to be pretty disinterested in taking part in the project and the deadpan, slapstick humour that the director has forcibly inserted in the movie falls flat for the most part.Is it a bad movie? I have seen worse! Dead Reckoning might not have the same intensity of Brian De Palma or Brad Bird's's take on the MI franchise. But nevertheless it is a good action movie that you could enjoy with your friends on a Friday night, but if you are expecting a deep movie that could make you question the very reality surrounding you, you are in for a wrong movie.

Dead Reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character development.The tone of the film is inconsistent. The visual effects poor. The stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesn't feel authentic because of heavy CGI. And with heavy heart I must say Cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any day.The film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didn't convince it even for a second.,dead reckoning starts with the promise of being the smartest of the franchise and ends up being a very poorly made film laden with bad dialogues and cringeworthy character developmentthe tone of the film is inconsistent the visual effects poor the stunt pieces are well choreographed but doesnt feel authentic because of heavy cgi and with heavy heart i must say cruise looked decent in half of the stunts in the movie which is considered a failure in any daythe film lacked emotions and although the stakes were supposed to be the highest but the film didnt convince it even for a second,Negative
"Beautiful locations with beautiful women, and plenty of action but is that enough?Probably not with a pretty absurd plot and Tom Cruise starting to show his age, yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them. When you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldn't be a need for a part two, but its all set up for that to happen and it's fair to say I will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensAs per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen , very similar to the James Bond films.",beautiful locations with beautiful women and plenty of action but is that enoughprobably not with a pretty absurd plot and tom cruise starting to show his age yes he does some stunts but pretty obvious not all of them when you consider the film is over two and a half hours long there shouldnt be a need for a part two but its all set up for that to happen and its fair to say i will not be losing any sleep waiting for that particular movie to hit our screensas per normal with this franchise it will always look better at a cinema rather than a television screen  very similar to the james bond films,Positive
"If you want to watch people running everywhere hiding keys in other peoples pocket you'll love this drivel.Don't get me wrong I love the MI movies but this one was about as interesting as the 4 hour lecture on grass seeds I had to try and stay awake through at college.I'm pretty sure the franchise is dead after this unless some amazing happens in part two, maybe they wall run round taking keys out of peoples pockets to mix it up a bit.Long and short of it I was very bored and glad I didn't go to the cinema to watch it, at least at home you can go and cook a fully roast dinner go for a 2 hour walk and sit back down and tom is still running somewhere.",if you want to watch people running everywhere hiding keys in other peoples pocket youll love this driveldont get me wrong i love the mi movies but this one was about as interesting as the 4 hour lecture on grass seeds i had to try and stay awake through at collegeim pretty sure the franchise is dead after this unless some amazing happens in part two maybe they wall run round taking keys out of peoples pockets to mix it up a bitlong and short of it i was very bored and glad i didnt go to the cinema to watch it at least at home you can go and cook a fully roast dinner go for a 2 hour walk and sit back down and tom is still running somewhere,Positive
"What on earth is this about, did everyone leave their brains at home with this movie.Plot?Sense?Common sense?I really don't know where to begin. I watched MI1 before watching this, a world apart. It was a great thriller, daft, but fun but what onearthe has this morphed into.I wanted to like this, please stop Tom, you're a great star and everyone concerned is super talented but you are all better than this.The further I watch the more confused I become, I'm routing for the Entity if it saves me from this torment.It's only part one so we're all going to have to sit through this again.",what on earth is this about did everyone leave their brains at home with this movieplotsensecommon sensei really dont know where to begin i watched mi1 before watching this a world apart it was a great thriller daft but fun but what onearthe has this morphed intoi wanted to like this please stop tom youre a great star and everyone concerned is super talented but you are all better than thisthe further i watch the more confused i become im routing for the entity if it saves me from this tormentits only part one so were all going to have to sit through this again,Positive
"I'm a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series, and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad. And this isn't either, but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other films.Dead Reckoning doesn't feel like one story split in two films, rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on it.The characters are decent, but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series. This movie commits the greatest sin a Mission: Impossible film could ever do: it's boring and void of tension or awe.Again, this is not a terrible movie, but we've seen much better from this franchise in the past. As the end credits roll on this movie, I can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing.",im a huge fan of the mission impossible series and while some movies are clearly better than others none of them have been outright bad and this isnt either but it swings closer to that precipice than any of the other filmsdead reckoning doesnt feel like one story split in two films rather it feels like one movie streched into two films with no reason other than making twice as much money on itthe characters are decent but neither the central conflict or the stunts come across as especially impressive compared to earlier entries in the series this movie commits the greatest sin a mission impossible film could ever do its boring and void of tension or aweagain this is not a terrible movie but weve seen much better from this franchise in the past as the end credits roll on this movie i can only hope that this is a rare weakpoint and not the beginning of a downward spirals for a series of films that have always managed to stick the landing,Positive
"Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to hold this key. The future of the world depends on it. So keep it safe. Oh yeah sure your jacket pocket will be fine. No, no need to check it. I'm sure it'll be fine. What's that? It's gone?!! Huh. Go figure.Better idea. Let's build up a character with huge emotional potential using one of the most major actresses of our time. Do it over 2 films. She's deadly. Intelligent. Now let's kill her. But no not really. Let's have her go into hiding. Ha! No not really. Got you again! Now let's have her die again. Do it off camera so we can film Tom running. Lovely running that. He's too late. She's dead. Really dead this time. But er nobody cares, cos, you know, just replace her with a not very good pickpocket.",your mission should you choose to accept it is to hold this key the future of the world depends on it so keep it safe oh yeah sure your jacket pocket will be fine no no need to check it im sure itll be fine whats that its gone huh go figurebetter idea lets build up a character with huge emotional potential using one of the most major actresses of our time do it over 2 films shes deadly intelligent now lets kill her but no not really lets have her go into hiding ha no not really got you again now lets have her die again do it off camera so we can film tom running lovely running that hes too late shes dead really dead this time but er nobody cares cos you know just replace her with a not very good pickpocket,Positive
"OMG, guys, I just saw the new Mission: Impossible movie, Dead Reckoning, and like, it was SO long! Like, seriously, I swear it felt like three movies in one. My butt was numb by the end, and I was checking my phone for the time way too much.Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise. He's, like, the ultimate action hero, right? But even he looked kinda tired in this one. I mean, the dude's gotta be pushing 60, and he's still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains? I get that Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a badass, but maybe they should give him a desk job at this point.And speaking of Ethan Hunt, the whole story just felt...off. I know Mission: Impossible movies are always crazy, but this one went way overboard. Like, there was sentient AI and stuff? I just wanted to see Ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet hand-to-hand combat against a worthy bad guy, not fight against some SkyNet wannabe.I guess what I'm saying is, Dead Reckoning just wasn't the classic Mission: Impossible experience I was hoping for. It was too long, Tom Cruise looked like he needed a nap, and the story was all over the place. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie, it's okay, but I'd rather rewatch Fallout instead.",omg guys i just saw the new mission impossible movie dead reckoning and like it was so long like seriously i swear it felt like three movies in one my butt was numb by the end and i was checking my phone for the time way too muchdont get me wrong i love tom cruise hes like the ultimate action hero right but even he looked kinda tired in this one i mean the dudes gotta be pushing 60 and hes still hanging off buildings and jumping off of trains i get that ethan hunt is supposed to be a badass but maybe they should give him a desk job at this pointand speaking of ethan hunt the whole story just feltoff i know mission impossible movies are always crazy but this one went way overboard like there was sentient ai and stuff i just wanted to see ethan use his cool gadgets and do some sweet handtohand combat against a worthy bad guy not fight against some skynet wannabei guess what im saying is dead reckoning just wasnt the classic mission impossible experience i was hoping for it was too long tom cruise looked like he needed a nap and the story was all over the place if youre looking for a fun fastpaced action movie its okay but id rather rewatch fallout instead,Negative
"I would have loved to enjoy this meeting but I simply could not.In prior M:I installments, there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling. But this time, I concur with someone who wrote earlier in a review that the story is soulless and empty.I found it a string of reprised sheer impossible action scènes stringed together by an excuse of a story line that made me feel like I missed the first half hour in which the stage was set - as such, I never got invested in the story.And it is not that there was not enough time to tell a story as we will most likely get a part 2 too.I get that this is an action movie and not a documentary. But it is all to improbable and even if it could happen irl, it has been done before, but in a better fashion.I wonder what part 2 will bring; to paraphrase Waldorf & Statler: ""probably stuff that was not good enough for the first one.""",i would have loved to enjoy this meeting but i simply could notin prior mi installments there was at least some character development as well as a story worth telling but this time i concur with someone who wrote earlier in a review that the story is soulless and emptyi found it a string of reprised sheer impossible action scènes stringed together by an excuse of a story line that made me feel like i missed the first half hour in which the stage was set  as such i never got invested in the storyand it is not that there was not enough time to tell a story as we will most likely get a part 2 tooi get that this is an action movie and not a documentary but it is all to improbable and even if it could happen irl it has been done before but in a better fashioni wonder what part 2 will bring to paraphrase waldorf  statler probably stuff that was not good enough for the first one,Positive
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A Review of Thrills and Misses
Strap in for a wild ride, but don't expect a masterpiece. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers on its promise of action, with adrenaline-pumping sequences that will leave you breathless. However, the film's complexity and pacing might leave you feeling lost and questioning the logic of some choices.Keeping track of the players: The large cast and intricate plot require viewers to pay close attention. You'll need to remember who's who and their motivations, which can be challenging, especially during the film's fast-paced moments.Car chases with diminishing returns: While the action sequences are impressive, particularly the motorcycle chase through Rome, some car chases feel unnecessarily long, dragging down the film's momentum.Pushing the boundaries of believability: The Mission: Impossible franchise has always flirted with the impossible, but even for this series, some moments stretch credulity too far. Venice, usually teeming with tourists, appears eerily empty, pushing the suspension of disbelief to its limits.Visually stunning, but not Oscar-worthy: The special effects are undeniably impressive, but the film relies heavily on them, sometimes at the expense of emotional depth and character development. While technically proficient, the film might not resonate with those seeking a more nuanced cinematic experience.Overall, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a fun, action-packed ride, but it's not without its flaws. If you're looking for a mind-bending thriller, you might be disappointed. However, if you crave heart-stopping stunts and a globetrotting adventure, this film delivers.","mission impossible  dead reckoning part one a review of thrills and misses
